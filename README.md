----------------------------------------------BLOODLINE---------------------------------------

Abstract:

Problem Statement:
Blood is one of the most important essentials of human life. In near future, we might see artificial bloodsubstituting for human blood, but till then blood donors are the safest and most important source of blood.
The journey of blood from a donor to a receiver is a complex landscape process. The blood after donated is tested, stored, transported and finally transfused. But when the blood is donated in many places the details of the sample are written using pen and paper. 

Proposed Solution:
Bloodline will help is conquering this issue using blockchain. This helps is tracking the blood from the time it is donated, till it is transfused. When the blood is donated,  this will generate a QR will have all the information and this can only be accessed with some extra information(Trap Door Algorithm). So when the blood is sent from one institution to other it can be easily tracked whether it is safe not.

Expected Outcomes:
The end user here will be the Organisations the collect blood from the donors and store them in the Blood Collection Centres, and the hospitals that request blood from these organistions.The actions that a end user will be able to perform will be :
                
                -->User should be able to Register for a new Account and login.
                -->Generate QR while receiving blood from a donor.
                -->Scan QR and check how safe the blood is.
